# Klarschiff â€“ Back-end


## Background

Basically, **Klarschiff** is a web portal for public participation. It is hoped to be a helpful application mainly for municipalities and other (public) administrative institutions to improve communication with their members (i.e. citizens, people). The application consists of two parts fundamentally linked together: the back-end (as provided and described here) and the front-end.

The back-end of **Klarschiff** is a web application which can be used by municipalities and other (public) administrative institutions to manage all incoming events reported via the corresponding front-end.

The project was initiated by municipality of Rostock (Germany), more precisely its land registry office.


## Language issues

Sorry folks, but currently, almost the whole project (i.e. the documentation, most of the code comments, the file names and the project name itself, of course) is available in German language only.

Hopefully we will find both the time and the spiritedness to improve this situation in the coming weeks and months together.


## Documentation

The current documentation is, as already mentioned above, available in German language only. Nevertheless, you are invited to read through the `dokumentation` directory.


## Demo

The initiators of the **Klarschiff** project are hosting a [demo version](http://demo.klarschiff-hro.de/backend) (login with the name `interner` and the password `interner`) of the project on their servers. This demo version uses the code hosted here on GitHub, with settings slightly adjusted to the local conditions, of course.

Apart from that demo, there is also a real-world productive version running on the initiators' servers which is accessible internally only.
