# Klarschiff – Back-end


## Background

Basically, **Klarschiff** is a web application for public participation. It is hoped to be a helpful tool mainly for municipalities and other (public) administrative institutions to improve communication with their members (i.e. the people). The application consists of two parts fundamentally linked together: the back-end (as provided and described here) and the front-end.

The back-end of **Klarschiff** is a web application which can be used by municipalities and other (public) administrative institutions to manage all incoming events either reported via the corresponding front-end or reported via the back-end itself.

The project was initiated by the municipality of Rostock (Germany), more precisely its land registry office.


## Language issues

Sorry folks, but currently, almost the whole project (i.e. the documentation, most of the code comments, the file names and the project name itself, of course) is available in German language only.


## Documentation

The current documentation is, as already mentioned above, available in German only. Nevertheless, you are invited to read through the `dokumentation` directory.


## Virtual machine demo

The initiators of the **Klarschiff** project are offering a ready-to-use virtual machine (VM) in [VMware format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vmdk) for download on their servers: it comes with the complete **Klarschiff** demo version pre-installed on it. The demo is executable locally – for more details see the readme file that is shipped along with the VM. The VM is compressed and made available as a 5 GB gzip archive via the following link: [klarschiff-demo-vm.tar.gz](https://geo.sv.rostock.de/download/klarschiff-demo-vm.tar.gz)


## Online demo

Additionally, the initiators of the **Klarschiff** project are hosting a [demo version](https://demo.klarschiff-hro.de/backend) of the project on their servers. This demo version uses the code hosted here on GitHub, with `settings.properties` slightly adjusted to the local environment, of course.


## In production

**Klarschiff** is running as a real-world productive version named **Klarschiff.HRO** on the initiators' servers but is accessible internally only.
